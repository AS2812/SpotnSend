  // Comprehensive Content
  'app_overview_content':
      'SpotnSend is a citizen safety app that lets users report hazards in real time (such as fires, accidents, floods, or crimes) and receive alerts about nearby dangers. It uses an interactive emergency response map to keep communities informed and safe. The app also forwards critical information to emergency services when needed. By engaging citizens in safety monitoring, SpotnSend helps reduce emergency response times and increase public awareness of local hazards.',

  'signup_guide_content':
      'Download SpotnSend and create an account using your mobile number or email. You will receive a verification code (OTP) to activate your account. Ensure you agree to the app\'s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use before proceeding.',

  'id_upload_guide_content':
      'For identity verification, SpotnSend requires you to upload a clear photo of your Egyptian National ID (بطاقة الرقم القومي). This confirms that each user is a real person. The app processes this ID securely and will use it only to verify your identity; it is not shared without your permission. (Note: National ID numbers and personal data are protected under Egyptian law.)',

  'reporting_guide_content':
      'To report a hazard, tap the "Report" button and choose the type of danger (fire, crime, accident, etc.). The app will use your GPS location or let you pin the location on the map. You can add a photo or description for clarity. Once submitted, your report is sent to other users nearby and relevant authorities (e.g. police or ambulance) if necessary.',

  'map_notifications_guide_content':
      'The app\'s main screen is a live map showing recent hazard reports as icons or markers. You can pan and zoom to see incidents in your area. You will receive push notifications about new dangers near you, based on your location. You can configure notification settings (e.g., radius or types of alerts) in the app. Stay aware: when you see a hazard on the map or receive an alert, use caution and avoid the area if possible.',

  'verification_guide_content':
      'SpotnSend may verify reports before broadcasting them to all users. This can involve confirming details with other users or officials. Verified reports help prevent false alarms. When you submit an ID or report, an admin review may approve your submission. Once verified, you will see a confirmation message.',

  'safety_principles_content':
      'Prioritize your safety. Do not approach dangerous situations; maintain a safe distance. If you are in immediate danger, call emergency services (e.g. 122 for police, 123 for ambulance in Egypt) before or while using the app. Verify information: treat app alerts as informational and confirm through official sources if possible.\n\nReport responsibly. Only submit accurate, on-the-ground information. Avoid jokes, pranks, or irrelevant content. Uploading unauthorized images (e.g. violent or private content) is prohibited. Remember that other users and authorities rely on your reports to stay safe.\n\nProtect privacy. Do not report personal details of others (names, license plates, photos of bystanders) without consent. Use of the app should not infringe on anyone\'s privacy rights.\n\nRespect the platform. Follow any community guidelines provided. Any misuse (spam, hate speech, harassment) can lead to warnings or account suspension. Keep your account information up to date, and notify the support team of any technical issues.',

  'identity_verification_content':
      'Identity Verification: SpotnSend requires your Egyptian National ID number and phone number to verify your identity. This ensures that reports come from real individuals. Your ID and phone are treated as personal data under Egyptian law. You must provide accurate information; submitting false identity details is prohibited and may lead to legal penalties.\n\nPrivacy Policy: Your personal data (ID, phone, location, etc.) are collected only with your explicit consent. We use this data solely to provide SpotnSend services (user verification, sending alerts, etc.) and to improve safety features. Data are secured and not retained longer than necessary. SpotnSend will not sell your personal data or share it with private parties. All processing complies with Egypt\'s Personal Data Protection Law (No. 151/2020), which requires transparency and security in handling personal information. You have the right to access or delete your data by contacting support.',

  'data_sharing_content':
      'SpotnSend will not share your ID or personal data with third parties without your consent, except as required by law. Your emergency reports (location, description, photos) are shared in real time with nearby users and may be forwarded to emergency authorities (police, medical responders, etc.) to facilitate quick assistance. Under Egyptian law, authorities (e.g. national security or police) can request personal data if necessary. SpotnSend will comply with valid legal requests and will notify you if your data must be disclosed due to a lawful order. Otherwise, your data are kept confidential.\n\nThe app does not sell or use your personal information for marketing. Aggregate (anonymized) data may be used internally to analyze trends and improve safety features (e.g. hot spots on the map), but this does not identify you personally.',

  'false_reporting_content':
      'Accuracy and Legal Accountability: Users must only report genuine hazards. Deliberately submitting a false report is prohibited. Under Egyptian law, spreading false information that threatens public safety is a crime. Violators can face severe penalties, including up to five years imprisonment and hefty fines. For example, intentionally disseminating false news about national affairs (or causing public panic) can lead to prison time and fines. SpotnSend may permanently ban any user found to be filing false or malicious reports, and will cooperate with authorities in any legal investigation.',

  'platform_usage_content':
      'Acceptable Use: You agree to use SpotnSend in a lawful and respectful manner. You may not use the app to commit crimes, harass others, send spam, or upload illegal or copyrighted content. Respect other users: do not impersonate someone else or misuse anyone\'s personal information. The app\'s community guidelines (if provided) must be followed at all times. Any violation of these rules may result in a warning, suspension, or permanent ban of your account.\n\nAccount Security: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials. Do not share your login or verification codes. If you suspect unauthorized access to your account, contact us immediately. SpotnSend is not responsible for any loss or misuse of your account due to your negligence.',

  'governing_law_content':
      'These Terms & Conditions are governed by the laws of Egypt. Any disputes arising from your use of SpotnSend will be resolved in the competent courts of Egypt. By using this app, you agree to abide by Egyptian law and consent to the jurisdiction of Egyptian courts.\n\nSources: Information on Egyptian data protection and false reporting laws were obtained from Egypt\'s Personal Data Protection Law and recent reports on penalties for false news. The jurisdiction clause is modeled on standard Egyptian terms of use. All policies adhere to current Egyptian legal requirements for identity and privacy.',

  'password_security_tips':
      'Use a strong password with at least 8 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. Avoid using personal information like your birthdate or name. Never share your password with anyone and don\'t use the same password across multiple sites.',
